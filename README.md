# Polynomial-Symmetry-Exploitation
Research Project Repository

This repository contains the code which I have written for my undergraduate research project regarding exploitation of symmetry in polynomial system solving. I have added the following functions:
- mixedVolumeSymmetryTest
- symStartSysFromFile
- newParseSolutions

My code resides in the PHCpack.m2 file which should be incorporated in the PHCpack repository to run under /src/Macaulay2/.
